# Binary Exploitation
- *level 1*: there is a buffer overflow vulnerability, the program will store a string `Hello, <USER_INPUT>!` into a 256-byte buffer, but there isn't a size check on the user input. The server provides a function to print out the address of the `win()` function, which displays the flag. What we need to do is to overwrite the return address of the `greet()` function to the address of `win()`. The structure of the current stack frame is (from low address to high address):
    - `[buffer (256 bytes)][previous rbp (8 bytes)][return address]` (stack layout)
    - `['Hello, ' (7 bytes) +  padding (257 bytes)][  win_address ]` (buffer overflow)
